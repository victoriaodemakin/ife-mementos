                                        <p>The psychological underpinnings of IFÉ MÉMÉNTOS work are based upon the artist’s personal history of as witnesses to the  chronic illness affecting their world and culture. Looking through the lens of an artist with history, they examines significant moments where older technologies like photography similarly failed to capture the female-identified body and its attendant madnesses. <br> These works suggest an unstable, monumental, body-as-architecture, under continuous construction -- or perhaps demolition.
 they looks at their early training as a photographer to amplify the eeriness of creating digital duplications of the human body within the space of the virtual. <br>  Their most recent series, Summer of Mystery , was created with Niyi Olu as a muse. These images speak to the inherent deathliness of 3D replications of the digital body, and suggest the separation of body and digital avatar as an almost religious operation. <br>  In all their works, the human body is de-materialized, separated from the physical, and then re-materialized into a vastly altered form. Subsequently, the artist challenges standard viewpoints by creating her own subjective, embodied and very human way of seeing through a technological lens.</p>
